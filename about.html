                    Our editors in chief are Anvika Singh, Giya Agarwal, and Tim Yin, three students at Interlake High School. 
                    We're an eager participant in the community of writing as a whole, nurturing it at our school
                    while increasing its awareness online, and advocate for writers everywhere to join, 
                    participate, and spread the love. Valuing creativity and passion, we’re also strong
                    advocates for artists and encourage collaboration between the two creative communities!

                Our mission strives to encourage the empowerment of youth writers through submission
                    online publication mediums such as our own, promoting values of creativity, passion, 
                    and courage. Through accessible free submissions, we create our channel for young writers 
                    to speak into the world, and for young artists to collaborate alongside them. Our 
                    different types of submissions— poetry, fiction, and nonfiction— were made broad 
                    and inclusive to advocate this goal further. We’ve received amazing work from students 
                    in many countries around the world, including China, Singapore, Slovenia, Saudi Arabia, 
                    and many more, and we hope to be able to publish writing and artwork from every country around the world.

                <h2>
                As high schoolers, we’ve found difficulties at times while trying to spread our writing that 
                submissions into different literary contests and other credible publishing sources due to reasons like cost, 
                restrictive conditions on submissions, to region-related exclusivity, and most significantly
                <i>preserving the integrity of our ideas</i>. It’s been discouraging to us both as writers and 
                as students. Young writers have deep and meaningful messages that should be shared to the world 
                regardless of where they’re from and what they have to say. 
                <br>
                Students need accessible platforms for them to showcase who they are. 
                <br>
                That’s why we started Saints and Fleurs, a litmag that all the youth can access and submit to.
